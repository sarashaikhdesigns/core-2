    the greatest love story of all time:
    </h1>

    <p>on may 21st, 1969,  beautiful, young couple, got married. they were completely in love. at the time in india, arranged marriages were the norm. but these two, married for love. this photo marks the beginning of a lifetime filled with love and happiness. </p>

    <p>together, they had four amazing children who they loved very much. two girls, then two boys. on september 10, 1973, their second eldest daughter was born.</p>
    
    <p>soon enough, she grew up, and they had to send her off to college all the way from india to america. it was hard, but they always put the needs of their children first.</p>
    
    <p>and their daughter got married to a handsome man who would love her for many years to come.</p>
