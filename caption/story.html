    <h1>
    the greatest love story of all time:
    </h1>

    <p>on may 21st, 1969,  beautiful, young couple, got married. they were completely in love. at the time in india, arranged marriages were the norm. but these two, married for love. this photo marks the beginning of a lifetime filled with love and happiness. together, they had four amazing children who they loved very much. two girls, then two boys. on september 10, 1973, their second eldest daughter was born.</p>
    
    <p>soon enough, she grew up, and they had to send her off to college all the way from india to america. it was hard, but they always put the needs of their children first. and their daughter got married to a handsome man who would love her for many years to come. they started a family of their own. </p>

<p> they had the most perfect baby girl, on march 29, 2004. she was the best of them all, the apple of their eyes, she never did any wrong. (that little girl is me) on january 5, 2010, they had another beautiful girl, but their eldest remained the favorite, of course. but of course, i remained the favorite of all the grandchildren (don’t tell my sister though).</p>

<p> flash forward to today, that original beautiful, young couple, grew up to spread their love and happiness to many generations to come. this website is a symbol of my love and gratefulness to my grandparents. if you are reading this, i love you both so much</p>

<p>love, sara</p>
