    <div class="text-reveal">this photo was taken of the strand in new york city.</div>
    <div class="text-reveal">i've always loved going into a new world through literature. i get to escape my real world problems and put myself in the shoes of a new character.</div>
    <div class="text-reveal">since moving to new york, i visit the strand at least once a week. it is safe to say that i have spent HUNDREDS of  dollars on books here alone.</div>
    <div class="text-reveal">the first time i ever came here was when i got accepted into parsons and went to tour.</div>
    <div class="text-reveal">as i am coding this website, my current read is the bell jar by sylvia plath.</div>

    <div class="text-reveal">this photo was taken of the snow in the upper east side.</div>
    <div class="text-reveal">how magical a day was the first fall of snow of the year!!! i went to central park with my best friends and play in the snow. it was so nostalgic and warming to watch all of the little children of manhattan gather to go sledding.</div>
    <div class="text-reveal">growing up in new york, i was always used to feet snow consistently piled up near my driveway. i have memories of it snowing on every major colder holiday from halloween to st. patrick’s day.</div>
    <div class="text-reveal">on this day, school was canceled!</div>
    <div class="text-reveal">but now, since i've moved back here for school, it’s only snowed a handful of times, and has never been more than a few inches MAX.</div>

    <div class="text-reveal">this photo was taken of the stairs of a gallery.</div>
    <div class="text-reveal">gallery openings on thursday evenings are my favorite activity after a long week of classes.</div>
    <div class="text-reveal">at these openings there is always wine and food.</div>
    <div class="text-reveal">it’s super cool to get to see artists, just like me, exhibit their work in the real world and make a living off of doing what they love.</div>
    <div class="text-reveal">sometimes, if i’m lucky, i get to meet and speak with the artist.</div>
    <div class="text-reveal">most of the times they’re in the chelsea area, but i’ve also been all over manhattan!</div>

    <div class="text-reveal">this photo was taken of printed matter in new york city.</div>
    <div class="text-reveal">most people who study or are interested in design in manhattan have definitely been to printed matter (and if you haven't i highly recommend).</div>
    <div class="text-reveal">i love to come here for inspiration and manifestations of what my work and future could be like.</div>
    <div class="text-reveal">the most recent book i made was for my typography class about home.</div>
    <div class="text-reveal">my goal is to sell one of my books there by the time i graduate.</div>
    <div class="text-reveal">there are two locations, chelsea (the main one) and the LES, this was taken in chelsea.</div>
    <div class="text-reveal">a few weeks ago, i participated in my own book fair with the school (spitting image) and it was such a fun experience to get my foot in the door of the professional world.</div>
