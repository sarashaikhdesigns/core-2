    <div class="text-reveal">this photo was taken of the strand in new york city.</div>
    <div class="text-reveal">i've always loved going into a new world through literature. i get to escape my real world problems and put myself in the shoes of a new character.</div>
    <div class="text-reveal">since moving to new york, i visit the strand at least once a week. it is safe to say that i have spent HUNDREDS of  dollars on books here alone.</div>
    <div class="text-reveal">the first time i ever came here was when i got accepted into parsons and went to tour.</div>
    <div class="text-reveal">as i am coding this website, my current read is the bell jar by sylvia plath.</div>
</div>
<div class="polaroid-2" data-id="2">

    <div class="text-reveal">this photo was taken of the snow in the upper east side.</div>
    <div class="text-reveal">how magical a day was the first fall of snow of the year!!! i went to central park with my best friends and play in the snow. it was so nostalgic and warming to watch all of the little children of manhattan gather to go sledding.</div>
    <div class="text-reveal">growing up in new york, i was always used to feet snow consistently piled up near my driveway. i have memories of it snowing on every major colder holiday from halloween to st. patrick’s day.</div>
    <div class="text-reveal">on this day, school was canceled!</div>
    <div class="text-reveal">but now, since i've moved back here for school, it's only snowed a handful of times, and has never been more than a few inches MAX.</div>

</div>
<div class="polaroid-3" data-id="3">
    <img src="images/3.png" class="image">
    <div class="text-reveal">this photo was taken of the stairs of a gallery.</div>
    <div class="text-reveal">gallery openings on thursday evenings are my favorite activity after a long week of classes.</div>
    <div class="text-reveal">at these openings there is always wine and food.</div>
    <div class="text-reveal">it's super cool to get to see artists, just like me, exhibit their work in the real world and make a living off of doing what they love.</div>
    <div class="text-reveal">sometimes, if i'm lucky, i get to meet and speak with the artist.</div>
    <div class="text-reveal">most of the times they're in the chelsea area, but i've also been all over manhattan!</div>

</div>
<div class="polaroid-4" data-id="4">
    <img src="images/4.png" class="image">
    <div class="text-reveal">this photo was taken of printed matter in new york city.</div>
    <div class="text-reveal">most people who study or are interested in design in manhattan have definitely been to printed matter (and if you haven't i highly recommend).</div>
    <div class="text-reveal">i love to come here for inspiration and manifestations of what my work and future could be like.</div>
    <div class="text-reveal">the most recent book i made was for my typography class about home.</div>
    <div class="text-reveal">my goal is to sell one of my books there by the time i graduate.</div>
    <div class="text-reveal">there are two locations, chelsea (the main one) and the LES, this was taken in chelsea.</div>
    <div class="text-reveal">a few weeks ago, i participated in my own book fair with the school (spitting image) and it was such a fun experience to get my foot in the door of the professional world.</div>

</div>
<div class="polaroid-5" data-id="5">
    <img src="images/5.png" class="image">
    <div class="text-reveal">this photo was taken of the mannequins inside of parsons school of design.</div>
    <div class="text-reveal">i currently attend university here and am in my second year, studying communication design.</div>
    <div class="text-reveal">living in manhattan and doing what i love for school and work feels so unreal.</div>
    <div class="text-reveal">i love having the city as inspiration around me and the people i've met on my journey through school have all been so cool.</div>
    <div class="text-reveal">this website was actually coded as a class project for my 'core 2: interaction' class.</div>


</div>
<div class="polaroid-6" data-id="6">
    <img src="images/6.png" class="image">
    <div class="text-reveal">this photo was taken of the jefferson market library in new york city.</div>
    <div class="text-reveal">there so many interesting books here…but i've actually never checked out a book from a new york public library…i prefer to own them.</div>
    <div class="text-reveal">i prefer to use this library as a study spot, which i enjoy going to frequently.</div>
    <div class="text-reveal">the building has incredible architectural design. my favorite part is the beautiful stained glass all over the walls in the whole library.</div>
    <div class="text-reveal">it's located in the west village and is such a cozy spot to get to do work</div>
    <div class="text-reveal">throughout the library they have so many cool things to explore and so many levels</div>
</div>
<div class="polaroid-7" data-id="7">
    <img src="images/7.png" class="image">
    <div class="text-reveal">this photo was taken of the metropolitan museum of art in new york city.</div>
    <div class="text-reveal">i try to go here as much while i still get free admission as a student.    </div>
    <div class="text-reveal">it’s by far my favorite museum in all of new york.     </div>
    <div class="text-reveal">no matter how many times i go, i still feel like i haven’t seen a fraction of what’s there. every time i go i discover a new part.    </div>
    <div class="text-reveal">i love seeing other artists there sketching/drawinging/painting their own versions of the originals.    </div>
    <div class="text-reveal">as i am coding this website, i most recently went to see a new textile exhibit just last weekend.</div>

</div>
<div class="polaroid-8" data-id="8">
    <img src="images/8.png" class="image">
    <div class="text-reveal">this photo was taken of an air vent in alphabet city.</div>
    <div class="text-reveal">i took this photo on the way to my favorite cafe: bcup.</div>
    <div class="text-reveal">it's such a hidden gem. i love doing work on their comfy couches and they have THE BEST banana bread i have ever had in my life.</div>
    <div class="text-reveal">alphabet city is definitely one of the most underrated parts of manhattan.</div>
    <div class="text-reveal">my friends and i call it alphabet soup…</div>
    <div class="text-reveal">i love exploring the different stores, restaurants, & bars they have there.</div>
</div>
<div class="polaroid-9" data-id="9">
    <img src="images/9.png" class="image">
    <div class="text-reveal">this photo was taken of gramercy park.</div>
    <div class="text-reveal">i am including this purely for manifestation purposes.</div>
    <div class="text-reveal">currently, i live a few blocks from gramercy park, and i take every opportunity i can to walk through it on my way to any destination.</div>
    <div class="text-reveal">walking around at night is especially magical, when you get to see all the rich, lit up apartments. if you peer in you can see wood paneled walls and rows and rows of leather-bound books.    </div>
    <div class="text-reveal">so, while i may not currently possess the key to gramercy park, i will one day.</div>
</div>
<div class="polaroid-10" data-id="10">
    <img src="images/10.png" class="image">
    <div class="text-reveal">this photo was taken of the inside of a bus in new york city.</div>
    <div class="text-reveal">i definitely prefer taking the bus over subway.    </div>
    <div class="text-reveal">but i've heard so many stories of people getting fined so now i take the bus with a bit more fear and i do pay on occasion…</div>
    <div class="text-reveal">when i first got to the city i remember thinking how nice it was that it was “free.”</div>
    <div class="text-reveal">the buses are so much cleaner and you don't have to take stairs. but sometimes i get stuck in traffic and it takes over an hour to get to my supposed “20 minute long” stop.    </div>
    <div class="text-reveal">i love how in new york you can take public transport to take you almost anywhere.</div>
</div>
<div class="polaroid-11" data-id="11">
    <img src="images/11.png" class="image">
    <div class="text-reveal">this photo was taken of the sunset over the streets in greenwich village.</div>
    <div class="text-reveal">i remember that day the weather was so lovely and that's all anyone would talk about on the streets.    </div>
    <div class="text-reveal">the photo does not do the colors of the sky justice at all. but then again, photos never do.</div>
    <div class="text-reveal">since i can remember, i've always felt the need to take a picture of the sunset. but it's kind of more rare to be able to actually see them in manhattan.</div>
    <div class="text-reveal">that day, i was feeling inspired so i bought a sketch book from blick and drew in madison square park.    </div>

</div>
<div class="polaroid-12" data-id="12">
    <img src="images/12.png" class="image">
    <div class="text-reveal">this photo was taken of the inside hallway of an apartment building in new york city.</div>
    <div class="text-reveal">i live in this apartment building with my three lovely roommates, ceci, ella, & lily.</div>
    <div class="text-reveal">our lease started april 1, 2023, and will now end april 30, 2024. but we just signed a lease to a new place!</div>
    <div class="text-reveal">we live in a six floor walk up and moved up all of our items from the dorms to here ourselves…would not recommend, but we are much stronger from this. we are hiring movers to move our stuff out this time.</div>
    <div class="text-reveal">this was the first time i ever lived in a real home without my family. the first time i started to feel like a real adult.</div>
    <div class="text-reveal">here is where i've learned to take care of myself.</div>
